## 📅 Session 1: Python Setup, Syntax Basics & Data Concepts  
📆 Date: 26th June 2025

In our **first session**, we introduced the basics of how Python works, the types of environments you can use, and foundational Python syntax.

### ✅ Topics Covered

#### 🧠 1. What is Software?
- Understanding **System Software** vs **Application Software**
- What is a **Programming Language**, and where does Python fit?

#### 📦 2. Distributions & Environments
- What is a **Distribution**? (E.g., Anaconda)
- Why we use distributions to package Python and its libraries.
- What is an **Environment**? (Conda/Virtual environments)
- Benefits of isolating dependencies for different projects.

#### ⚙️ 3. Ways to Run Python
- Python CLI (`python`)
- Python IDLE (Graphical Interpreter)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- `.py` Script files
- Google Colab (online execution)
- IDEs like VS Code

➡️ Refer to the folder:  
[`Python-Class-1-Runningtypes-Identifiers-Variables`](./Python-Class-1-Runningtypes-Identifiers-Variables)

#### 🔤 4. Comments in Python
- **Single-line comment**: Using `#`
- **Multi-line comment**: Using triple quotes `'''` or `"""`
  
#### 🗝️ 5. Keywords
- Reserved words like `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, etc.

#### 🪪 6. Identifiers
- Names for variables, functions, classes.  
  Must start with a letter or `_`, can't start with a number.

#### 📊 7. Data Structures in Python
- **Primitive**: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`
- **Abstract**: `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`

## 📅 Session 2: Memory, Typing, and Python Data Structures  
📆 Date: 05th July 2025

In our **second session**, we focused on how Python manages memory internally and looked deeply into both primitive and abstract data types.

### ✅ Topics Covered

#### 🧠 1. Programming Language Fundamentals
- What is a Programming Language?
- Low-Level vs High-Level
- Static vs Dynamic Typing
- Interpreters vs Compilers
- How Python code is executed
- What is Clang, CPython, and why a C compiler matters?

#### 🔧 2. Python Execution Internals
- `.py` files → compiled to `.pyc` → executed by Python Virtual Machine
- Jupyter Notebook cells and kernel architecture

#### 🔹 3. Primitive Types with Properties & Memory
- `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, `complex`
- Memory size using `sys.getsizeof()`
- Methods, functions, and real-world stories to remember

#### 🔸 4. Abstract Data Structures
- `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`
- Mutability, order, duplicate rules
- Key methods and memory footprint
- Easy analogies (basket, lunchbox, fridge, pantry)
