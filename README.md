## ðŸ“… Session 1: Introduction to Python & Software Environments

In today's session, we covered the fundamentals of how Python runs, the concept of software, and how different environments allow us to write and execute Python programs.

### âœ… Topics Covered

1. **What is Software?**  
   - Understanding the difference between system software, application software, and programming languages.
   - Where Python fits in (Python as a high-level programming language).

2. **What is a Programming Language?**  
   - How languages like Python allow humans to communicate with machines.
   - Pythonâ€™s advantages in data science.

3. **What is a Software Distribution?**  
   - Introduction to **Anaconda Distribution**: A bundle that includes Python, libraries (like NumPy, Pandas), and tools like Jupyter Notebook.
   - Why we use distributions to avoid dependency issues.

4. **What is an Environment?**  
   - Explanation of Python environments (virtual environments, conda environments).
   - Importance of isolating dependencies for different projects.

5. **Different Ways to Run Python Code:**
   - âœ… Python CLI (Command Line Interpreter)
   - âœ… IDLE (Python's built-in GUI)
   - âœ… Jupyter Notebooks (via Anaconda or standalone install)
   - âœ… VS Code or any IDE
   - âœ… Online platforms like Google Colab
   - âœ… Scripts via `.py` files
   - âœ… Interactive Python shells like IPython
