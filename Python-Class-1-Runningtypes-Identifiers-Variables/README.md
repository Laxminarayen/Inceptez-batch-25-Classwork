## 📅 Session 1: Python Setup, Syntax Basics & Data Concepts  
📆 Date: 26th June 2025

In our **first session**, we introduced the basics of how Python works, the types of environments you can use, and foundational Python syntax.

---

### ✅ Topics Covered

#### 🧠 1. What is Software?
- Understanding **System Software** vs **Application Software**
- What is a **Programming Language**, and where does Python fit?

#### 📦 2. Distributions & Environments
- What is a **Distribution**? (E.g., Anaconda)
- Why we use distributions to package Python and its libraries.
- What is an **Environment**? (Conda/Virtual environments)
- Benefits of isolating dependencies for different projects.

#### ⚙️ 3. Ways to Run Python
We explored multiple methods to run Python code:
- Python CLI (`python`)
- Python IDLE (Graphical Interpreter)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- `.py` Script files
- Google Colab (online execution)
- IDEs like VS Code

### 🔤 4. Comments in Python
- **Single-line comment**: Using `#`
- **Multi-line comment**: Using triple quotes `''' '''` or `""" """` for documentation or blocks.

### 🗝️ 5. Keywords
- Reserved words in Python like `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `class`, etc.
- Keywords cannot be used as variable names or identifiers.

### 🪪 6. Identifiers
- The names we use for variables, functions, classes.
- Rules for valid identifiers:
  - Must begin with a letter (A–Z, a–z) or underscore (`_`)
  - Cannot start with a number
  - Can contain letters, digits, and underscores
  - Case-sensitive

### 📊 7. Data Structures in Python

#### 🔹 Primitive Data Structures
- `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`

#### 🔸 Abstract (Built-in) Data Structures
- `list`
- `tuple`
- `set`
- `dict`

Each structure was explained with basic syntax and examples.
